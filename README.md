## Welcome to StudyBuddy!

StudyBuddy is a **communication platform where students can chat with tutors for homework help.**
In return, tutors can gain valuable teaching insights and give back to the local community of learners, making StudyBuddy a great interface for teachers-in-training.

Users can sign up for StudyBuddy as a tutor or as a student.
Users are also asked to **specify their level of learning or teaching (ex. university or highschool) and subjects they are interested in learning or teaching.** 

**Using data from Google Maps API and collecting zip code information from tutors and students,** StudyBuddy recommends tutors to students and students to tutors to chat with.
Recommendations are based on physical proximity and matching subjects of tutors and students.
